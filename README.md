## comments by team members on their contribution
-Akshat Vijesh ITA320
-I learned how web applications are developed from start to finish. I understood how the frontend and backend connect and how everything works together. I used HTML and Bootstrap for the layout and design, Python for backend logic, and SQLite for handling the database. I also worked with Pillow for image processing and learned how to manage routes, templates, and static files. Overall, I got a clear idea of how to integrate different technologies to build a complete web application.
